# Find-IMDB-Rating
find IMDB rating of movie with node.js

## Why need this?
Sometime, we rent DVD and store it for ourself.
We create a folder with name of movie we kept.
Besides, we want to know the rating for the movie.

## How to use?
1. Just put the read.js file to the folder you create to store movie directories.
1. If necessary, rename the directory same with name of the movie.
For example, you have a folder called Movies. And there are two movies in "Movies" directory, such as frozen and the%20martians ( if there's space, switch it to %20).
Then cd /path/to/Movies/, and node read.js
